            Jane Austen was an English novelist who lived between 1775 and 1817
            and became known to the general public during the so called Regency
            Era. In her lifetime she wrote six main novels, themed around love
            and friendship, listed below in order of publishing date:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sense and Sensibility (1811)</li>
            <li>Pride and Prejudice (1813)</li>
            <li>Mansfield Park (1814)</li>
            <li>Emma (1815)</li>
            <li>Northanger Abbey (1817, posthumous)</li>
            <li>Persuasion (1817, posthumous)</li>
          </ul>

          <br />
          Since their first appearance Jane Austen's novels have been in
          continuous publication and her works have been greatly appreciated by
          her contemporaries. Despite her success, in the end at least, it took
          quite some time for the writer to have her books in printing. Below
          some fun facts about Jane Austen and her books.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Jane Austen published her first book,
            <strong><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></strong>, at her own expences, at the cost of £460, a sum representing a
            third of her household income. She sold 750 copies and made a profit
            of £140.
          </p>

          <p>
              In 1811, writing was considered a scandalous occupation for a woman, so Jane Austen published <strong><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></strong> anonymously, signing the book only as <em>A Lady.</em>
          </p>
          <p><strong><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></strong> was her first published novel, but not the first she had written. In 1803 she had already finished what would have been then known as <strong><em>Northanger Abbey</em></strong> with the title of <em>Susan.</em> The novel was a not so veiled mocking of the very popular gothic genre, inspired in particular by the books by Ann Radcliffe.  <br>
            The writer sold her novel to Crosby & Co. , a London publisher, but it was never printed, maybe in fear of offending Radcliffe herself, which very famous at the time. She tried to get her novel back, but it took nearly fifteen years before she could claim it as hers again. She then reworked entire sections of the book, but she died before she could see it in print. <strong><em>Northanger Abbey</em></strong> was published posthumously in 1817.  </p>

          <p>Despite the fact that all her book are about love and the pursue of marriage, Jane Austen has never been married, but she indeed received a  marriage proposal in 1802 that ended in a very strange way. <br>
         Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra were visiting their longtime friends Alethea and Catherine Bigg, when their brother Harris Bigg-Wither, declared his love to the writer.
         He was five years her junior, considered a man not very charming or good mannered. Maybe fearing a life of solitude, the writer accepted the proposal. Jane and Cassandra were staying at night at the Bigg's house, but during the night the writer changed her mind and the follwing morning she refused the proposal and departed immediately, returning home.
        </p>
        <p>The Prince Regent was a great admirer of Austen's work: he was so in love with her novels that he made his librarian invite her to a tour of his London residence. The librarian said to Austen she was <em> “at liberty to dedicate any future novel to him” </em>, intending the Prince Regent whished to have a book dedicated to him. <br>
        The problem was that Jane Austen could really not stand the Prince Regent, who had the reputation of being a dissolute man, but she didn't dare to  refuse a request from such a high power, so she dedicated <em>Emma</em> in a way that was half an homage and half a mock:
        <br>
        <br>
        <blockquote>
           <p class="quotation"> <em >To His Royal Highness, The Prince Regent. This work is, by his Royal Highness’s permission, most respectfully dedicated by His Royal Highness’s dutiful and obedient humble servant, The Author. </em> </p>
          </blockquote>
     <br>
    </p>
    <p> Jane Austen loved to write letters, one her unfinished works, <em>Lady Susan</em> was even an epistolary novel. She was witty and she was considered, not surprisingly, a charming letter writer, but we have very little of her letters left, because at her death, her beloved sister Cassandra destroyed them all, fearing maybe that the light tone of her personal writing could harm her reputation as serious writer. </p>
